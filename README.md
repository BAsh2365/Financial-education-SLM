Financial SLM chatbot using Model and architecture from Ollama, ChromaDB, and Langchain


Understanding the Power of Local Language Models ( SLM financial chatbot)
From Information and Tutorials gathered online (Like Tech With Tim: https://youtu.be/E4l91XKQSgw?si=SF3J4wYa_O5tijCE), using Python, Ollama, Langchain, the Yahoo Finance API, and various compiled, trusted financial sources (such as Investopedia, Fidelity, BlackRock, etc.) I built a local financial assistant that helps users enter personal financial information (which is not shared with anyone) on their local machine and answers any quick questions related to investments, retirement, and other financial topics. The goal of the SLM is to serve as a tool, educating people on finances through specific use cases. (Note: This is not a replacement for a Financial Advisor, but rather an educational tool for understanding finances.) When used correctly, local language models can be a powerful tool that works with people to achieve solutions, while learning throughout the process, and can be scaled to work with developers, analysts, etc. In a sustainable way.
